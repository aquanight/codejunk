Setting up test table:
do
local __refs = {
}
_ = {
	[1] = 1
	[2] = 2
	[3] = 5
	[4] = 6
}
done

First trial of splice - inserting 2 elements into the sequence.
TEST: there should be no results returned
PASS
Verification of x:
do
local __refs = {
}
_ = {
	[1] = 1
	[2] = 2
	[3] = 3
	[4] = 4
	[5] = 5
	[6] = 6
}
done

TEST: There should only be 6 keys, from 1 through 6.
PASS	See dump
Second trial of splice - removing 3 elements from the sequence.
TEST: there should be 3 results returned: 3, 4, 5
PASS	3	4	5
Verification of x:
do
local __refs = {
}
_ = {
	[1] = 1
	[2] = 2
	[3] = 6
}
done

TEST: There should only be 3 keys: 1, 2, and 3.
PASS	See dump
Third trial: a longer insertion of 4 random numbers.
The random numbers that will be inserted are:
841	395	784	799
TEST: As before, there should be no results returned.
PASS
Verification of x:
do
local __refs = {
}
_ = {
	[1] = 1
	[2] = 2
	[3] = 841
	[4] = 395
	[5] = 784
	[6] = 799
	[7] = 6
}
done

THere should be now 7 keys: 1 through 7.
PASS	See dump
Final trial: replacing the 4 random numbers previously inserted
with the correct sequence (3, 4, 5).
TEST: The 4 random numbers from before should have be returned.
PASS	841	395	784	799
Verification of x:
do
local __refs = {
}
_ = {
	[1] = 1
	[2] = 2
	[3] = 3
	[4] = 4
	[5] = 5
	[6] = 6
}
done

There should be now only 6 keys: 1 through 6.
PASS	See dump
